INLOOP, the *INteractive Learning center for Object-Oriented Programming*, is a Python web
application to manage online programming courses, powered by Git, Django and Docker:

- **Flexible**: you can write tasks for arbitrary programming languages, as long as they can be
  packaged into a Docker image.
- **Secure**: solutions are checked inside a minimal and strictly isolated Docker container, which
  is discarded after execution.
- **Modern**: push-based (or periodic pull-based) import of tasks, Markdown task descriptions and
  accompanying material from a Git repository.
- **Fast & scalable**: solutions are processed asynchronously by a configurable number of
  background workers.
- **Easy to extend**: modern, modular and PEP-8 compliant Python 3 code base with less than 3000
  lines of code, good test coverage and continuous integration tests.


## Quick start

INLOOP requires the following software:

* Debian 8+ or Ubuntu 16.04+, macOS 10.11+ (for development only)
* Python 3.5 or 3.6
* Docker 1.10+ ([Docker setup](docs/docker_setup.md) **!!!**)
* Redis 2.6+
* Git 2.3+ ([workarounds for older Git versions](docs/git_troubleshouting.md))
* PostgreSQL 9.3+ (for production deployment, not needed for development)

Using the command line, a development instance can be set up as follows:

1. If you don't have it already, install [pipenv](https://docs.pipenv.org/install/).
   If you run into trouble, the known "good" versions of the build tools are listed in
   [build-requirements.txt](build-requirements.txt).

2. Install required software with `./support/scripts/debian_setup.sh` (Debian/Ubuntu) or
   `./support/scripts/macos_setup.sh` (macOS).

3. Run `make init` and `make loaddb` to bootstrap your local development environment.

4. Start and monitor the development web server and huey workers with `pipenv run honcho start`.

5. The previous step prints the address and port number of the local webserver that was started.
   You can immediately log in using the demo user accounts *admin* and *student* with the password
   *secret*.

You can use our [Java example task repository][repo-example] as a starting point to explore INLOOP.
